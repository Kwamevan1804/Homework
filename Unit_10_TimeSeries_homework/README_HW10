## ARMA MODEL
For (p,q)=(2,1), the ARMA model ar/ma p values are well above 0.05 so does not seem to be a good fit.
However, for (p,q)=(1,1) (indicated by the acf plot), the ar/ma p values both drop to zero

## ARIMA MODEL
For (p,d,q)=(5,1,1), ARIMA model ar/ma p values well exceed 0.05
For (p,d,q)=(1,1,1), ar/ma p values are zero so seems a better fit? The forecast graph look
comparable across (p,d,q) configurations.

## GARCH MODEL
For (p,q)=(2,1) p-value for lag 2 is well above 0.05

CONCLUSIONS
Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

Both the ARMA and ARIMA models predict positive (but declining) returns for the yen in the near term, 
suggesting a potentially good buy moment.

Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

Given near-term forecast of increasing volatility, the yen risk is expected to increase modestly.

Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

No, the p-values for the suggested p,q orders are not robust. Interestingly (p,q) orders of (1,1)
seem to produce robust p-values.

## LINEAR REGRESSION

CONCLUSIONS
The regression performs better on out-of-sample data with an rmse of 0.41 vs 0.71 for the in-sample 
data. However the r2 scores for both in-sample and out-of-sample data are very low. The scatter plots
including the regression lines also suggest minimal correlation between Lagged_Returns and Daily_Returns.
