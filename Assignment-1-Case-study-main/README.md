# MAKERDAO: A STABLECOIN USE CASE

## Overview and Origin

MakerDAO is a blockchain project that issues and manages cryptocurrencies pegged to the USD (“stablecoins”). The project launched in 2015 and issued its first whitepaper in 2017. MakerDAO was founded by current CEO Rune Christensen who was previously involved with BitShares, an early stablecoin pioneer. Rune recognized the potential of stablecoin and, as the project struggled to gain traction at BitShares, decided to launch Maker together with some other Bitshares community members. 

The MakerDAO corporate structure currently consists of the Maker Foundation which employs the management team and supervises management of MakerDAO the open-source project governed in a decentralized manner by MKR governance token holders. Holders vote on key issues affecting the Maker Protocol, a decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain that manages the Maker’s stablecoin ‘Dai.’ One of MakerDAO’s strategic objectives is to fully decentralize governance. Consequently, the Maker Foundation intends to dissolve itself once MakerDAO can manage governance completely on its own.

MakerDAO has raised $27m across three funding rounds since ‘17. Key investors include Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain. 


## Business Activities:

MakerDAO seeks to address real world use cases with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It recognizes the significant potential of cryptocurrencies to improve the way people spend, send and save money. Cryptocurrencies can not only process transactions cheaper, faster, and with more transparency than conventional banks, they also offer access to these financial services to anyone with a smartphone, no bank account required. However, a significant drawback of cryptocurrencies has been their extreme price volatility which undermines their ability to fulfill three basic functions of money: store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.

MakerDAO intends to solve this issue by issuing a ‘stablecoin’ called ‘Dai’, a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the USD and hence significantly mitigates price volatility. It accomplishes this by backing each ‘dai’ with collateral consisting of other liquid crypto assets (much like the USD used to be directly backed by gold before the gold standard was revoked in 1933). Furthermore, it maintains the USD peg by employing a ‘Price Stability Mechanism’, a system that intervenes in the market when the Dai value deviates from the peg both via open market transactions and rate setting actions (much like the Fed’s monetary tools). 

With price volatility mitigated, the stablecoin Dai is positioned to achieve much better market adoption for use cases like sending money to a friend, paying in online or offline stores or remitting money overseas. Dai holders can also save their Dais on the Maker Protocol and earn an attractive return by locking their Dai into savings rate contracts.

MakerDAO’s Dai users include consumers looking for cheaper, faster money or remittance alternatives, or businesses looking for a better alternative to accept non-cash payments compared to conventional card payments. The total addressable market is significant. The global remittance market alone amounted to close to $700bn in 2018.

MakerDAO’s main revenue drivers currently are stability fees and liquidation penalties levied on Dai holders. Incremental revenue streams are forthcoming (eg merchant payment fees described in Recommendation). 

Following are five key Dai use cases:

Inflation Protection and Savings. Stablecoins have seen significant early adoption in areas of the world with high local currency volatility and inflation and limited access to more stable currencies. Since anyone can buy, transfer and hold stablecoin Dai, it has seen significant adoption in Latin America, in particular in Argentina where Dai has become the most popular crypto by exchange volumes, ahead of even Bitcoin.

DeFi. DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance which refers to applications that provide financial services without conventional intermediaries, incl. saving, lending and borrowing. Dai is the most used cryptocurrency in the DeFi space thanks to its composability facilitating integration.

Gaming. Digital currencies like Dai have quickly gained ground in replacing virtual currencies used in virtual gaming worlds due the ability to quickly move funds in and out of systems as well as the lack of a central authority that could devalue the currency or unilaterally discontinue their use. 
 
Digital Art. As digital artists adopt blockchain technology by using one-of-a-kind, limited-supply blockchain assets called non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent their original singular art works, art auctions are beginning to accept stablecoins like Dai. 

Ecommerce. Despite the tremendous growth in ecommerce volumes, the industry still faces payment inefficiencies incl. chargebacks, volatility and payment processing fees. In 2018 Coinbase launched a merchant payment service that includes Dai as an accepted payment currency.
 
MakerDAO has become one of the largest players in the DeFi space due to a few advantages. First their Maker Protocol has successfully scaled Dai issuance to well over $1bn today. This has required robust technology to manage collateral posting to support Dai exchange including automated liquidation auctions executed via smart contracts (in case collateral value drops).

Second, their decentralized governance system has uniquely enabled invaluable user feedback as governance token (MKR) holders tend to be Dai holders. It’s as if a start-up’s early customers automatically become shareholders and help design the product.

Third, due Dai’s early success, a host of third-party decentralized applications (Dapps) have emerged that leverage Dai. Dapps include applications in crypto wallets and savings (eg Argent, Oasis, Trezor), crypto ATM operators (Coinsource), remittances (Wirex), ecommerce payments (Origin Protocol), portfolio management (Tokensets), marketplaces (OpenSea) and gaming (Skyweaver). The resulting growing ecosystem creates powerful network effects.

In terms of underlying technologies, the Maker Protocol operates as a Dapp on top of the Ethereum blockchain (in fact, it’s one of the first and largest Dapps on ETH). Hence users incur Ethereum transaction fees (“gas fees”) when transacting Dai. Customer’s collateral are held in Maker Vaults created via various third party interfaces including Oasis Borrow. Smart contracts link these Vaults to the Maker Protocol (eg automated collateral liquidation auctions to preserve over-collateralization ratios).

Price Oracles are individual nodes in the Maker Protocol selected by MKR holders responsible for delivering accurate collateral pricing info via Price Feeds in order for the Protocol to monitor ‘loan-to-collateral value’ ratios and initiate automated liquidation auctions when necessary.

A major technology upgrade was completed in 2019 when MakerDAO phased out the initial ‘single-currency Dai’ (‘SCD’), backed by a single collateral type (ETH) and focused exclusively on ‘multi-currency Dai’ (‘MCD’) supporting a growing set of liquid cryptocurrencies as collateral.


## Landscape:

MakerDAO is a blockchain company and currently one of the largest DeFi applications. DeFi applications use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to provide financial services such as payments, lending and saving without intermediaries such as banks. Major DeFi applications such as MakerDAO, Aave, Uniswap, Compound and Balancer have seen tremendous growth over the past 12-24 months as users have flocked to their lending and borrowing offerings driven by both arbitrage opportunities and attractive yields. As a result the amount of liquidity contributed to the respective platform ‘liquidity bases’ have surged to well over $1bn. Moreover, the DeFi applications aim to decentralize decision-making by issuing governance tokens to their coin holders. These governance tokens carry the right to vote on key platform decisions as well as potentially capture a share of platform economics. Due to the latter feature, these governance tokens have increased in value as well, no doubt partially helped by the resurgence of more speculative cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

One trend that can potentially significantly drive DeFi adoption is the introduction of crypto debit cards. These crypto cards seek to marry the convenience and efficiency of crypto holdings with the ubiquity of existing card networks like Visa and Mastercard. In short, these cards integrate with users crypto wallets and automatically execute crypto-fiat conversions at interbank rates across a wide variety of global currencies at the point of sale. This approach ensures wide merchant payment acceptance while DeFi companies launch their own payment merchant services described below. These could ultimately become an attractive substitute for conventional payment rails.


## Results

As a privately held start-up, MakerDAO does not publish detailed financial metrics but below some available operating metrics. In 2020, MakerDAO achieved $1bn of Dai cryptocurrency in circulation. Moreover, over $2.8bn is locked into Maker smart contracts, making it the largest DeFi applications on this score. Other metrics MakerDAO has published for 2020 include the expansion of acceptable crypto collateral from 2 to 16, increase in number of vaults opened (user measure) from 3,100 to 17,800 and growth in number of third party integrations from 355 to 900. 


## Recommendations

I would recommend that MakerDAO promotes Dai payment solutions for online and offline merchants. This year has seen a surge in online payments from an already sizable transaction volume of $3.53tn in 2019, with forecasts suggesting 60% year-on-year growth through 2022 and global retailers expected to take $5.7tn in payments by then. 

Yet the current payment system contains significant inefficiencies including high processing fees and the risk of chargebacks which can be addressed by blockchain technology and provide a cheaper, faster and more secure payment solution. A number of crypto merchant services have launched incl. BitPay, Coinbase Commerce and Coingate helping to process an estimated $4bn worth in Bitcoin payments in 2019. However, a major hurdle remains: most cryptocurrencies are volatile forcing merchants to quickly exchange crypto for fiat and incurring associated fees.  

Dai combines the features of crypto (speed and transparency) and fiat currency (reliable price) while avoiding the risk and costs of conventional internet payments incl. chargebacks and high transaction costs. Specifically, Dai offers the following benefits: low volatility removes need for fiat conversion, lower fees (crypto gas and network fees are lower than interchange fees), no chargebacks (transactions are permanent and immutable), mobile compatible (Dai is integrated with many mobile wallets), positive brand identity (merchants benefit from tech-savvy image) and easy onboarding through various existing merchant platform plug-ins.

MakerDAO can choose to promote its own merchant payment offering, integrate with existing offerings listed above or pursue both. Either way, given the size of the market opportunity, successful adoption has the potential to significantly drive Dai usage thereby generating attractive economics for MakerDAO via earned fees (eg stability fees). 

In terms of required technologies, integration with existing payment service providers to include Dai as an accepted payment currency is already in place. Launching its own merchant payment service offering would require development of merchant platform integration solutions so customer transactions can be ‘acquired’ once initiated and validated/settled in real-time across merchant and customer crypto wallets. Once the required technology is in place, a major challenge will be the ability to robustly scale the platform to efficiently process large, cross-border transaction volume.
