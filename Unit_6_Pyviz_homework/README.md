For top-10 most expensive neighborhoods, I selected the most recent, 2016, sale prices only as opposed to the average across 2010-2016 as it seemed more relevant.

The rental_analysis notebook includes Matlibplot plots which I converted to Plotly plots in the dashboard notebook.

The dashboard is structured as a tabs object where you select content by clicking on the column labels.
